Analysis-of-COVID-19-Infections-vs.-Result-of-2020-Presidential-Election-by-State

Third Project for CS 432 at Binghamton University

Using a dataset of COVID-19 information last updated around November 3rd, 2020, I looked for
any possible correlation between how states were affected by the pandemic and how they voted in
the Presidential Election. Dataset was imported into MongoDB, and read into a Java program to
find average COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 related death information based on how states voted.
